## Expert systems (SNZ)
### Private lessons

This repository holds the code from the private lessons held by me for the course 'Expert systems' at the FCSE (FINKI) - Skopje. The code consists of solved tasks serving for the exam in the mentioned course.

The course programming language is `python` and the topics covered are: decision trees, document classification (Naive Baes and tf_idf vector representation), recommender systems and time series.
